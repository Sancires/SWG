# Sancires' World Generator
## About
SWG is a world generation datapack replacing existing vanilla generation. The goal of SWG is to replicate a vanilla feel whilst still modifying and creating biomes that have a unique feel, while additionally incorporating elements not found in normal Minecraft worlds, such as the addition of skeleton horses and giants. For a full list of biomes, view the biome list [here](https://github.com/Sancires/SWG/wiki/Biomes).

## Contributing
Currently, SWG is seeking developers interested in handling multi-noise biome placement. If you are interested, please contact `Sancires#3417` on Discord.
